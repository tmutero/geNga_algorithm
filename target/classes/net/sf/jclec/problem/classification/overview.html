The JCLEC classification module is an intuitive, usable and extensible open source module for genetic programming (GP) classification algorithms. This module is an open source software for researchers and end-users to develop classification algorithms based on GP and grammar guided genetic programming (G3P) models. It houses implementations of rule-based methods for classification based on GP, supporting multiple model representations and providing users the tools to easily implement any classifier. This library is a module for JCLEC, which is a software system for Evolutionary Computation (EC) research, developed in the Java programming language. JCLEC provides a high-level software environment to do any kind of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), with support for genetic algorithms (binary, integer and real encoding), genetic programming (Koza style, strongly typed, and grammar based) and evolutionary programming.

The classification module includes some GP and G3P proposals described in the literature, and provides the necessary classes and methods to develop any kind of evolutionary algorithm for easily solving classification problems.
